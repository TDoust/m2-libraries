/* Following code creates files "data1", "data2", "data3" and "data4" in dir "0:" and "data5", "data6", "data7" and "data8" in dir "test" and writes data to them. Alsi it performs speed test. 
 * Than it creates list of files on card. 
   This is made in setup function since we want to do that once. Check Getting Started Guide for Debug options (Debug is enabled by default). 

   CAUTION!
   Code only works if there is no directory or file with the same name. Code first checks if name is alredy used when is needed. */
